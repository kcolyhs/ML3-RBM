Outline
- Pre-processing
	- Dealing with categorical data
- Restricted Boltzman Machine
 	- Why we chose this over other models
 		- Robust to small changes in the data
 		- Stochastic nature helps it not overfit
 		- Useful in scarce data
 		- probabilistic so works well with n-grams
- Natural Language Processing/Generation
	- n-grams
